# Introduction to React Exercise Application

This project was created with React and utilizes Rapid API and Materials UI to display a wide range of different exercises, what equipment is used, video links to see how might the exercise appear in real life, and the muscles each exercise targets. 


# Objective
To build a web application using React to improve my skills in using React, and to have a web application that is very simple, responsive, and well designed for user friendly access to different exercises. The simple search bar and display of each exercise and its targeted muscle group in a quick gif lets individuals get a quick grasp on how and what the exercise does for them. Utilizing Youtube Search Rapid API allows for the app to pull videos from Youtube to showcase the exercise done in person. 

# Optimization
These are further optimizations I am looking to add or in the middle of implementing when there is time.

-A dark mode for ease on the eyes
-The similar exercises and similar equipment component should have a redirect to the actual exercise once clicked upon.

- Create a `.env` file in config folder and add the following as `key = value`
  - REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY = your Rapid API key
